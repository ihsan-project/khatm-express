    ## API Key
    It's good practice to validate a key for all requests. This key isn't encrypted nor a secret, it's only a first line of defense against crawlers. All Khatm's APIs require the `x-api-key` header to be present.

    ## Authorization
    Khatm will only support SSO from the client platform (Android, iOS) to maintain security, while reducing the need to manage authorization flows such as verifying emails or encrypting and storing passwords.
    The client application will send the service's SSO information to the Khatm API as a `UserAuthorization`.
    The response will be a `User` with an `access` property which will need to be set as the `Authorization` header of subsequent API calls.
    If a user has the same email information between SSO services, the system will tie the `UserAuthorization`s to that user, and user will be able to login to same account using both SSO services.

    ## Challenges
    Moderators create `Challenge`s. A challenge has a `book` that contains metadata regarding what type of challenge this is.
    Based on the type of book (quran, dhikr, etc), the `total_parts` will mean something different
    - If `quran` then there will be 30 total_parts for each Juuz.
    - Otherwise the total_parts will be the the total count the moderator wishes to achieve. i.e. 30,000 Kalimahs

    ## Books
    Books are the types of khatm challenges that a moderator can create.
    These will be created by Admins and have `slug_id`s so can be identified. These are long-living objects that are going to be referenced by `Challenge`s in a one-to-many relationship.
    One of the first type of `Book`s will be the Quran. Other types of Books would be one for each Dhikr. Books can contain extra information such as the value of the dhikr, and historical or spiritual context.

    ## Intentions
    Users commit to a challenge through an `Intention` that they create.
    There can be only one `active` intention per user per challenge. Users can have one Intention in multiple Challenges.
    The `parts` property of an Intention plays two roles based on the book.type,
    - If `quran` then parts will be the index of which Juuz.
    - Otherwise the total_parts will be the the number of recitations the User has Intentioned

    ## State Machines
    Objects such as `ChallengeState` and `IntentionState` are a way of tracking the state change of objects, and when that state has changed.
    This makes it easy to track history of events in the system.
